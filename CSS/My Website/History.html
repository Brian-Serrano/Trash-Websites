<span class="history1"><h1>History</h1>
<span class="history2">It was one evening in the early summer of 1927 that a very memorable occasion took place at the Cabugao CRISER Market Building. Seated on borrowed desks and benches were the prominent elders and parents of the town surrounded by a milling crowd of noisy toddlers and urchins. A little further at the market stalls were the teenagers stealthily glimpsing at one another lest their ever watchful parents or aunts would catch them and cut short their temporary blissful togetherness.<br><br>
At the head table were the illustrious leaders of the town; Eustaquio Baclig of the famous West Point Military Academy, George Tossi Barbers of the US Army and a  Fil-American War veteran, Don Crispin Concepcion Serrano then Presidente of Cabugao, and Atty. Maximo J. Savellano – a brand new member of the Philippine Bar. The other members of the town’s elite group were either seated at the front seat or were conducting some whispering campaign among the parents. The atmosphere was one of tense anticipation.</span>
